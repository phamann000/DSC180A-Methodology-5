**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

One of the most interesting topics covered in my domain this quarter occurred when we learned why machine learning is so important to analyzing genomics data. One of the biggest reasons to use computers and machine learning to process data is when datasets are very large, and genomics data is very very large. Several gigabytes large for singular specimens. This is because most of the human genome is actually "junk". This is because about 98\% of human DNA's only function is to replicate itself, and doesn't code for any other function other than replication of replication. That's why machine learning is so useful to parse through this large amount of junk data/

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation for project 2 is using our quarter 1 model ,which detects and predicts unusual variants in genomic data, to search for drug resistant strains of bacteria. This may be a possible avenue to explore because bacteria need to mutate, causing changes in their genome, in order to become drug resistant so we hope to find what nucleotides may be associated with drug resistance in a certain bacteria like malaria.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change in approach is assigning more specific coding tasks in order to better guide and help the timeline of model production as I feel as if we are a bit behind in developing our model.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I'm not sure of other techniques I'd be interested in using in my project. Currently we are developing a dilated convolution type model to predict genetic variants, but part of the mentor team specializes more in transformer models, so it could be interesting to pivot or compare how a transformer model performs vs. how a dilated convolution model performs.
