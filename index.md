**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

One of the most interesting topics covered in my domain this quarter occurred when we learned why machine learning is so important to analyzing genomics data. One of the biggest reasons to use computers and machine learning to process data is when datasets are very large, and genomics data is very very large. Several gigabytes large for singular specimens. This is because most of the human genome is actually "junk". This is because about 98\% of human dna's only function is to replicate itself, and doesn't code for any other function other than replication of replication. That's why machine learning is so useful to parse through this large amount of junk data/
